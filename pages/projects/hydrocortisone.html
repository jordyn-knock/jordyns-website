      <h1>Hydrocortisone Production Through the Fermentation of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (baker's yeast)</h1>
      <p>
        This project developed a continuous bioprocess to produce pharmaceutical-grade hydrocortisone by genetically engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, optimizing fermentation conditions, and purifying the product through separation, chromatography, and crystallization steps to achieve over 98% purity.

      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
      As our bioengineering course’s project this past semester (2024-2025 winter term 2), myself alongside my amazing teammates had the opportunity to design a process in which hydrocortisone is produced through the fermentation of genetically engineered <i> Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>, which is just bakers yeast. 

      </p>

      <p>
      The process is as follows. The yeast is modified to express mammalian genes (CYP17A1 and CYP21A1) that enable the biosynthesis of hydrocortisone from glucose. A continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) is used to cultivate the yeast under tightly controlled conditions—25°C, pH 6.5, and limited light exposure—to optimize production. The growth medium includes glucose, ammonium sulfate, vitamins, and essential trace elements. Genetic enhancements, including codon optimization and secretion pathways, improve the yeast’s ability to produce and release hydrocortisone efficiently.

      </p>
      <p>
      After fermentation, hydrocortisone is purified through a series of steps: centrifugal separation using a hydrocyclone, thermal precipitation, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and two crystallization stages. The final product, a white powder with over 98% purity, meets U.S. Pharmacopeia standards for clinical use. This process offers a scalable and efficient alternative to chemical synthesis, supporting the growing medical demand for hydrocortisone.
