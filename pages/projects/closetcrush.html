      <h1>ClosetCrush (March 2025) </h1>
      <p>
        Inspired by the early 2000s vibe, for the cmd-f 2025 hackathon, my teammates and I decided to create a website that allows you to create an all-in-one online shopping wishlist. 
        You can save your favourite finds via a link from the store's website, mix and match pieces in the Style Studio, and preiview outfits put together.

      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        ClosetCrush was born from our personal struggles as indecisive online shoppers who often spent days hovering over the "purchase" button. Driven by nostalgia for childhood favorites like the Bratz dress-up simulator, and Cher's iconic wardrobe app from Clueless, we designed ClosetCrush as an interactive Wishlist platform with a playful, vintage aesthetic. Our goal was simple: to transform online shopping into a whimsical, enjoyable experience, reminiscent of dressing up dolls and dreaming of Cher’s or Barbie’s endless closets.

        ClosetCrush functions as an interactive Style Studio, allowing users to seamlessly save items from various online stores into organized categories. Users can quickly upload clothing details—such as hyperlinks, costs, and brand names—to build their personalized virtual closet. From there, the fun begins: mixing and matching outfits in a game-like interface and "crushing" favorites for future reference.

        We combined HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js  to ensure both flexibility and reliability. All data is saved locally (for now), but everything is set up to use MongoBD to make it remote.  Despite encountering challenges with API integrations, image scraping, and version control, our team's perseverance led us to deliver a fully functional, responsive prototype within just 24 hours.

            ClosetCrush provided invaluable experience collaborating in a team environment under tight deadlines.
