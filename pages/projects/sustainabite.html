      <h1>Sustainabite (April 2025)  </h1>
      <p>
        For the youCode 2025 haackathon, my team and I created Sustainabite, 
        a web application designed to fight food waste while making sustainable eating easier. 
        Sustainabite allows users to input the groceries they have on hand and instantly generates 
        recipes tailored to their ingredients, dietary preferences, and portion sizes. I was really excited to hear that this idea was on theme, since I had actually come up
         with it months before and just never had the time to execute it. For that reason, I am really proud of the project we made.

      <h2>About the Project</h2>
     
      <p>
      Sustainabite was inspired by the growing issue of food waste and the difficulty of 
      planning meals that use what you already have at home. Many people buy groceries 
      with the best intentions, only to throw out unused ingredients. Sustainabite solves 
      this by serving as a smart kitchen companion: it helps users reduce waste, save money, 
      and make eco-friendly choices without the hassle of overcomplicated apps. I had the pleasure of training the overarching AI bot, 
      and I can safetly say I learned a lot about training AI models during those stressful 24 hours.
    <p>
    <p>
      <strong>How we built it:</strong> Sustainabite is powered by a large Kaggle dataset of 
      500,000+ unique recipes. We built a streamlined frontend with <strong>Streamlit</strong> and developed 
      several custom machine learning models:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Image Detection (CLIP by OpenAI):</strong> Identifies ingredients from user-uploaded photos, 
        pulling from a list of 500+ common ingredients.</li>
      <li><strong>Overarching AI Model :</strong> Retrieves recipes based on user inputs (ingredients, cuisine, cooking time).</li>
      <li><strong>Cuisine Model :</strong> Predicts cuisine from ingredient lists across 15+ cuisines.</li>
      <li><strong>Meal Model:</strong> Experimented with meal type classification, later deprecated due to overly strict filtering.</li>
      <li><strong>Time Model:</strong> Built to identify cooking times from recipe steps, though refined to use multiple-choice time options for the prototype.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The frontend included features like <em>Find Recipe</em>, a <em>Pantry Cupboard</em> for managing grocery lists, 
      and <em>Favorites</em> for saving recipes.
