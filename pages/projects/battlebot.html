      <h1>BattleBot (Oct. 2024 - Nov. 2024) </h1>
      <p>
        Inspired by the show "Battlebots", myself and my 3 friends built a prototype battlebot named Nigel. Nigel was built using a 3-D printed chassis, an Arduino Uno, as well as an L298 driver board to control the wheels. After various iterations and many lessons learned, we ended up with a product we are proud of.

      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        Alongside my 3 friends, we decided to create a prototype of a compbat robot. I coded the arduino to work with the motors as well as a servo motor to control the hammer. This was a part of a larger proposal to implement the project into a UBC design team.
        We used Gantt charts and risk matrices for the project, teaching me a lot about project managment and optimizing project performance by utilizing different peoples skills.

          <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
          <p>
            Although I gained minimal experience working with arduino's in first year, we did not physically connect to them (only on tinkercad). This project taught me a lot about hardware connections and wiring. Additionally, we ran into some errors with the weight on the front wheels, and had to imporvise creating an axel with two skewers and a pulley. From this, I grew to consider the strong effect of weight distribution on a moving part.

            Through working with a team on this project, I also developed many soft skills. By using Gantt charts, we were able to mitigate any confusion in deadlines and tasks. Additionally, we used Notion to track project progress, a platform that served very helpful.
