          <h1>About Me</h1>

          <p><strong>Hi! I'm Jordyn,</strong> a third year Chemical and Biological Engineering student at UBC.</p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about tackling complex challenges and excelling in innovation-driven environments. I have gained hands-on experience through my past and present internships, and I am driven to push the boundaries of possibility and problem-solving.

          <h3>Internships</h3>
          <p>
            My journey has been shaped by impactful internships at LuxBio, and MOLLI Surgical, now a part of Stryker. I am currently working at LuxBio, a biotechnology company that makes light from enzymes! I work as a Bioprocess Technician where I assist in automating fermentations and the downstream processing of protein. Last summer as well as the previous summer, I worked for MOLLI Surgical during the time that they were acquired by Stryker.  I developed a range of skills in product testing, failure analysis, and prototyping.  I led the investigation into a sensor error, conducted non-destructive testing, and contributed to the MOLLI Accuracy Robot project.

          <h3>UBC Projects</h3>
          <p>
           At UBC, I am an active contributor to the UBC Rapid design team, where I work on updating the website as well as working with a team on developing a filament recycler. Specifically, I work closely with two others on the shaft of the filament recycler, doing material research and necessary calculations. Here I get the experience of working with other teams to create a larger project. I completed two projects in my second year through my UBC courses. The first was researching and developing a method to produce hydrocortisone, and the second was a process to produce Oxalic Acid. There is more information about both of these on the projects page. Finally, I have completed two hackathons so far at UBC, both which also can be read about on the projects page.

          <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
          <p>
           Beyond my technical achievements, I am a committed team player who enjoys mentoring others and fostering creativity. This past summer was my first summer spent in BC, and I took quite the liking to hiking. I also found myself really enjoying getting creative with air dry clay. I play intramural volleyball and hockey, and I really enjoy cooking and baking (I'm always looking for new recipes - if you have one, reach out!). Whether designing sustainable solutions, collaborating on exciting robotics projects, or exploring new technologies, I am always eager to learn, grow, and make an impact.
