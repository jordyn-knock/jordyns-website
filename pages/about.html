        <p>
          ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jordyn Knock, a passionate and driven student second year student pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Chemical and Biological Engineering at the University of British Columbia.
          With hands-on experience in cutting-edge projects and a strong foundation in engineering principles, I thrive on solving complex challenges and pushing the boundaries of innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey has been shaped by impactful internships at Stryker and MOLLI Surgical, where I developed a range of skills in product testing, failure analysis, 
          and prototyping. At MOLLI Surgical, I led the investigation into sensor malfunctions, conducted non-destructive testing, and contributed to the MOLLI Accuracy Robot project.
          These experiences honed my technical expertise in Python, CAD modeling, and quality management systems while teaching me the importance of collaboration in high-pressure environments.
        </p>
        <p>
        At UBC, I am an active contributor to the UBC Rapid design team, where I work on updating the website as well as working with a team on developing a filament recyler. Specifically, I work closely with two others on the shaft of the filament recyler, doing material research and necessary calcualtions. Here I get the experience of working with other teams to create a lagrer project. 
        My technical skills include python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript (well, from making this website), as well as CAD software like Fusion360, and SolidWorks. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, I study processes - including process flow diagrams and process economics. This equips me with the mindset to understand the bigger picture in any project, and really enhances my skillset. You can learn more about the courses I am taking and my thoughts on them under "thoughts".
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my technical achievements, I am a committed team player who enjoys mentoring others and fostering creativity. In my free time I play intramural volleyball and hockey. I really enjoy cooking and baking (I'm always looking for new recipies - if you have one, reach out!). Whether designing sustainable solutions, collaborating on exciting robotics projects, or exploring new technologies, I am always eager to learn, grow, and make an impact.
        </p>
