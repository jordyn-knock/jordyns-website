          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p><strong>Hi, I'm Jordyn Knock,</strong> a second-year Chemical and Biological Engineering student at UBC.</p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about tackling complex challenges and excelling in innovation-driven environments. With hands-on experience in advanced projects and a solid foundation in engineering principles, I am driven to push the boundaries of possibility and problem-solving.

          <h3>Internships</h3>
          <p>
            My journey has been shaped by impactful internships at Stryker and MOLLI Surgical, where I developed a range of skills in product testing, failure analysis, and prototyping. At MOLLI Surgical, I led the investigation into sensor malfunctions, conducted non-destructive testing, and contributed to the MOLLI Accuracy Robot project. These experiences honed my technical expertise in Python, CAD modeling, and quality management systems while teaching me the importance of collaboration in high-pressure environments.

          <h3>UBC Projects</h3>
          <p>
            At UBC, I am an active contributor to the UBC Rapid design team, where I work on updating the website as well as working with a team on developing a filament recycler. Specifically, I work closely with two others on the shaft of the filament recycler, doing material research and necessary calculations. Here I get the experience of working with other teams to create a larger project. My technical skills include Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (well, from making this website), as well as CAD software like Fusion360 and SolidWorks.

          <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
          <p>
            Beyond my technical achievements, I am a committed team player who enjoys mentoring others and fostering creativity. In my free time, I play intramural volleyball and hockey. I really enjoy cooking and baking (I'm always looking for new recipes - if you have one, reach out!). Whether designing sustainable solutions, collaborating on exciting robotics projects, or exploring new technologies, I am always eager to learn, grow, and make an impact.
